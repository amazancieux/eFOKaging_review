# A review of semantic and episodic Feeling-Of-Knowing in aging 

In this project we are re-analysing previously published datasets focusing on episodic FOK in aging. In light of broader work on metacognition, we propose that the eFOK deficit observed in aging is a consequence of a first-order deficit (also known as the Memory Constraint Hypothesis). We are first performing a meta-analysis to estimate the effect of the eFOK deficit in the literature. Second, we are using several methods to control for episodic memory performance and estimate an updated effect.
